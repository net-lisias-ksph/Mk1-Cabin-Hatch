Hi,

This "Mk1-Cabin-Hatch" mod add a stock-alike hatch to the stock Mk1 crew cabin's roof from witch you can go and come in EVA.

The hatch is now available as a part variant for the stock "Mk1 Crew Cabin" part.

BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY:
In previous versions older than v0.2.0 the option was toggle-able in the editor via the part's right-click menu "Add Top Hatch".
There is a compatibility patch file for the transition named "DEPRACTEDcompatibilityPatch.cfg.txt" located in "Kerbal Space Program/GameData/MK1CabinHatch", you have to rename it to "DEPRACTEDcompatibilityPatch.cfg" (remove the .txt extension at the end) to activate it. So you will have both versions of the hatch model and time to migrate your crafts. Once none of your crafts have the old model you can rename the compatibility file back with the .txt extension.

fully compatible with a running career and allow to be uninstalled without braking your crafts (the part will just be without the top hatch).

It sets "noAutoEVAMulti = False" to allow the kerbal to go in EVA from a ship with more than 1 part(!).

You have to install the mod "Module Manager" to make this mod works properly.

This part reuse the stock textures to save your RAM, those included are fake of 4x4 pixels.
It uses the "KSP Add-on Version Checker" mod if you have it installed (not included in this download) to check its version by using a connexion on my GitHub page given below, read the "KSP Add-on Version Checker" page for more details.

Dependency mods:

-Module Manager

Installation:

-Copy/paste the folder "MK1CabinHatch" in your "Kerbal Space Program/GameData" directory.

-Enjoy!
